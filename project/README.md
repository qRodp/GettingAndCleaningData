Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
=========================================

Introduction
------------
This repository contains my work for the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data", part of the Data Science specialization.
What follows first are my notes on the original data.

About the raw data
------------------

The features (561 of them) are unlabeled and can be found in the x_test.txt. 
The activity labels are in the y_test.txt file.
The test subjects are in the subject_test.txt file.

The same holds for the training set.

About the script and the tidy dataset
-------------------------------------
I created a script called run_analysis.R which will merge the test and training sets together.
Prerequisites for this script:

1. the UCI HAR Dataset must be extracted,
2. the UCI HAR Dataset must be available in a directory called "UCI HAR Dataset"

After merging testing and training, labels are added and only columns that have to do with mean and standard deviation are kept.

Lastly, the script will create a tidy data set containing the means of all the columns per test subject and per activity.
This tidy dataset will be written to a tab-delimited file called tidy.txt, which can also be found in this repository.


Files in the repository
-----------------------
`CodeBook.md` explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses of this project.

`run_analysis.R`
---------------

1. Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
2. Load the activity and feature info
3. Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which
   reflect a mean or standard deviation
4. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those
   columns with the dataset
5. Merges the two datasets
6. Converts the `activity` and `subject` columns into factors
7. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average value of each
   variable for each subject and activity pair.
